        <h1>Monsters at Work (2021-)</h1>
        <p>
          Monsters at Work begins the day after Henry J. Waternoose III's
          arrest, with the Monsters, Incorporated factory making the transition
          to laugh power. Tylor Tuskmon, a recent Scare Major graduate from
          Monsters University, having previously received a letter of acceptance
          from Waternoose to be a scarer at the factory, is excited to work at
          the same company as his idol Sulley. However, Tylor is devastated to
          learn that the company is no longer in need of scarers, and he is
          reassigned to work as a mechanic on the Monsters Inc. Facilities Team
          (MIFT). Meanwhile, Mike and Sulley encounter the trials and
          tribulations of running the company.
