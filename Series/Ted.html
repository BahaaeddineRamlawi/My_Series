        <h1>Ted (2024)</h1>
        <p>
          By 1993, Ted the foul-mouthed teddy bear's moment of fame has passed.
          He's moved back in with his best friend, likable but awkward
          16-year-old John Bennett, who lives in a working-class Boston home
          with his parents, Matty and Susan, and cousin Blaire. Matty's a
          blustering, blue-collar Bostonian who thinks he's the unequivocal boss
          of the house and doesn't like anyone challenging him, particularly his
          liberal-minded niece. Susan is kind, selfless and almost
          pathologically sweet when it comes to caring for her family. Blaire is
          a smart and politically correct college student who's not afraid to
          speak her mind and frequently clashes with her more traditionalist
          family.
