        <h1>Night Has Come (2023-)</h1>
        <p>
          After their midterm, the 10th graders of Yoo II go on a school retreat
          and arrive at a secluded retreat center located in the deep mountains.
          Then, a mysterious app is installed on the students' phones, and the
          deadly Mafia game begins. Not knowing what awaits them ahead, the
          students vote, not too seriously, for Heo Yul. However, when midnight
          strikes, Heo Yul kills himself, plunging everyone into a deep sleep
          along with the message "Night has come" on their phones. The next day,
          another friend is found dead, leaving students in confusion, but soon
          they realize the "Mafia Game" has become real.
