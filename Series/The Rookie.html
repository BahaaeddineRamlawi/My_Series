        <h1>The Rookie (2018-)</h1>
        <p>
          Starting over isn't easy, especially for small-town guy John Nolan,
          who, after a life-altering incident, is pursuing his dream of becoming
          an LAPD officer. As the force's oldest rookie, he's met with
          skepticism from some higher-ups who see him as just a walking midlife
          crisis. If he can't keep up with the young cops and the criminals,
          he'll be risking lives -- including his own -- but if he can use his
          life experience, determination and sense of humour to give him an
          edge, he may just become successful in this new chapter of his life.
