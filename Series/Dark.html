        <h1>Dark (2017-2020)</h1>
        <p>
          When two children go missing in a small German town, its sinful past
          is exposed along with the double lives and fractured relationships
          that exist among four families as they search for the kids. The
          mystery-drama series introduces an intricate puzzle filled with twists
          that includes a web of curious characters, all of whom have a
          connection to the town's troubled history -- whether they know it or
          not. The story includes supernatural elements that tie back to the
          same town in 1986.
