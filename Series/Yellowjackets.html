        <h1>Yellowjackets (2021-)</h1>
        <p>
          "Yellowjackets" tells the narrative of a team of wildly talented
          high-school girls soccer players who survive a plane crash deep in the
          Ontario wilderness. The series chronicles their descent from a
          complicated but thriving team to warring, cannibalistic clans, while
          also tracking the lives they have attempted to piece back together.
          Sophie Nélisse, Jasmin Savoy Brown, Sophie Thatcher and Sammi Hanratty
          star as the teenagers, while Melanie Lynskey, Tawny Cypress, Christina
          Ricci and Juliette Lewis portray their adult counterparts as they
          reveal the truth about their survival 25 years later.
