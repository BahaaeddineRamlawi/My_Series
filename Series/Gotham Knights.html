        <h1>Gotham Knights (2023)</h1>
        <p>
          Batman is dead, and a powder keg has ignited Gotham City without the
          Dark Knight to protect it. In the wake of Bruce Wayne's murder, his
          adopted son Turner Hayes is framed for his killing. With the
          charismatic and hard-charging District Attorney Harvey Dent and the
          GCPD hot on his trail, Turner must rely on allies including his best
          friend and formidable coder Stephanie Brown, and unlikely Batman
          sidekick Carrie Kelley. However, they soon learn there is a larger,
          more nefarious force at work within Gotham City. This team of
          mismatched fugitives must band together to become its next generation
          of saviors known as the Gotham Knights.
