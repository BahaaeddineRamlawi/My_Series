        <h1>The Lazarus Project (2022-)</h1>
        <p>
          An affecting exploration of modernity and the desire and ability to
          take charge of one's future. George thinks he is beginning to lose
          touch with reality when he finds himself living the same day, over and
          over again. A chance encounter with a man called Archie reveals that
          George is very much in touch with reality, but that reality can be
          stranger than fiction. With George's newfound understanding of his
          power and perception of space-time, he is forced to choose between
          loyalty to an organisation trying to save the world and the ability to
          rewrite the past for a friend.
