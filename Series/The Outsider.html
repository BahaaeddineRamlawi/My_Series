        <h1>The Outsider (2020)</h1>
        <p>
          Based on Stephen King's best-selling novel of the same name, "The
          Outsider" begins by following an investigation which at first seems
          like it will be simple and straightforward but things change as it
          leads into the gruesome murder of a young boy by a seasoned cop. When
          an insidious supernatural force edges its way into the case, it leads
          the investigators to question everything they believe in. The
          character of Holly Gibney from "Mr. Mercedes" is a major character in
          this series.
